That’s what excites me about this Senior Mobile Developer role: the chance to bring that kind of seamless experience to Android and iOS at scale.\n\nIn my recent role at Unbox Universe, I led the Flutter/Kotlin development of a smart battery passport app that helped the company secure €12M in Series A funding. Before that, at Eden Life, I re-architected the Flutter app and cut onboarding time from 24 minutes to 4 minutes, which tripled user activation. \n\nI’ve also worked on fintech, blockchain, and productivity apps, shipping products to 10K+ users and SDKs running in thousands of weekly sessions.\nI’m fluent in Flutter, React Native, Swift, and Kotlin, and I’ve built with REST APIs, clean architecture, and Git-driven workflows across multiple teams. But what really drives me is ownership, I like being in environments where I can take a feature from idea to deployment, and see users actually benefit from it.\n\nI’d love the chance to bring that mindset and experience to your team, while also learning from the challenges that come with building apps that need to be both high-performing and user-friendly.\n\nLooking forward to the possibility of chatting more.\nBest,\nChizi Ogbonda",
